# Andrew's Portfolio & Softball RSVP App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project with a **separated microservice architecture**:

- **Vercel**: Hosts the web app, database, cron jobs, and API routes
- **Railway**: Provides persistent WhatsApp connection and messaging

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```
Vercel (Web + Database) ‚Üê‚Üí Railway (WhatsApp) ‚Üê‚Üí WhatsApp Groups
     ‚Üë                         ‚Üë
  MongoDB + SendGrid      Persistent Baileys
  Cron Jobs + UI          Connection + QR Setup
```

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### **Step 1: Vercel Environment Variables**

Create a `.env.local` file for local development:

```bash
# MongoDB
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# SendGrid (for email notifications)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=your_verified_sender_email

# Railway WhatsApp Service
RAILWAY_WHATSAPP_URL=https://your-railway-app.railway.app
WHATSAPP_GROUP_ID=your_group_id@g.us

# Admin Access
RESET_SECRET=your_reset_secret_token

# App URL (for links in messages)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Update for production
```

### **Step 2: Railway WhatsApp Service**

The WhatsApp functionality runs on Railway for persistent connections. See the `RailwayBaileys/` directory for:

- Express server with WhatsApp endpoints
- Web interface for QR code generation
- Persistent authentication storage
- Auto-reconnection logic

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application.

For WhatsApp functionality in development, you'll need the Railway service running.
